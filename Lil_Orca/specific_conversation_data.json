Lil_Orca brought to the table intricate rhymes and a strong presence, relying on the notion of algorithmic agility and digital dominance.\n\nBoth competitors had their strengths, but one must rise above. It was a closely fought battle, but the edge goes to G-Turbo for his crafty punchlines and more varied and precise attacks, which provided a stronger overall performance.
